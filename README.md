# Single_Page_CV
In this exercise, I've created a 'dummy' resume template based on HTML semantics, SEO meta tags, OG tags, favicon, SEO keywords and basic HTML structure.

# Lessons Learned
First things first, every website and/or app must be semantic. This is not an ifs, and or but the reason for this is so that the browser can pick up on the website in order to rank websites and apps accordingly. When there is no semantic tags, the browser cannot read the site/app properly not to mention this can be bad for those who use AT (assistive technology). SEO is not for marketing and business professionals, your website must be able to attract visitors in order to reach your businesses or company goals. This includes using the appropriate semantic tags, more than one meta tags, and using WordStream to help me with this mini project.

# Challenges
Normally I would use HTML or JS in a heartbeat to get rid of the whitespaces for some items but, for the title tags for the education and dates but, wrapping the content in a paragraph tag as I had done with the address, phone number and email by adding a break tag between them did not work. This can be rectified by CSS.
